## Win Key Test


</div>

### Description

Do you have a borderless form as your main form? Do you know that it won't respond to the Win+M key (Minimize All Windows)? Do you know it doesn't have an icon in the taskbar? Do you know that the user can't click on the taskbar button for your program to minimize it? Well, this is the solution for all of those problems. The code basically creates another form and hides it off screen and makes that form the parent of the main form. This allow you to accomplish all of the above. Just download the code and see.
